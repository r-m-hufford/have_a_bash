# ðŸª¤ BASH

I have been doing bash algos for a little while. I am going to start putting them here.

### Why do I want to learn bash? There are a few reasons...

1. I want to become comfortable with the language used for server management, scripting, automation, devops, ci/cd and other activities that I see as helping me become a senior dev.

2. Even though bash is a high level scripting language, I want to be familiar with service/process/memory management, partitioning and formatting drives, file systems and security practices a little closer to where the rubber meets the road ðŸ›ž.

3. I bought a bash sticker and I want to feel honest about having it on my laptop.
